## AlphaDAO


**AlphaDAO is a POC project for token investment management on the Sui blockchain**



## Short Description
This project contains a Move smart contract for creating, participating in, and managing an on-chain token asset management fund.


## Full Description
The objective of asset management firms is to provide returns on cash deposited by investors. The investors benefit from the returns, which aim to beat keeping your money in a deposit account, and the asset managers benefit from a performance-based commission for providing this service.


In TradFi this operates on a model of trust; investors trust that the asset managers do not run away with their cash, that the cash is only traded in certain assets, and that defined risk limits are not breached.


AlphaDAO is a protocal that allows groups of traders (called "asset managers" in TradFi) to setup their organisations on-chain via a DAO (decentralised autonomous organization). This provides the following advantages:
- Security: tokens are locked in smart contracts, and transfer logic is pre-defined.
- Openness: anyone can be an asset manager or investor.
- Accountability: all trade transactions are recorded and visible on-chain.
- Voting rights: members can cast votes for actions such as removing a trader.


Additionally, the AlphaDAO project aims to bring the best practices from TradFi asset management to DeFi, including:
- Diversified teams with capital allocations
- Risk limits
- Token restrictions
- Lock-in and notice periods
